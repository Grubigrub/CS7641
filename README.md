To use this package, the python packages to use are numpy, scikit and matplotlib.

There are 3 different modes to run each python file.

* parametre : Plot the curves obtained by tweaking the parameters
* learning : Plot the learning curves
* final : Print the final score on the testing set and the confusion matrix

To run a file in a certain mode, execute "python3 file.py mode". For example, to plot the learning curves with the Decision Trees, execute "python3 tree.py training_size".

There are 5 files:

* tree.py : Scripts related to the Decision Tree
* neural.py : Scripts related to the Neural Networks
* boost.py : Scripts related to the Boosted version if the Decision Trees
* svm.py : Scripts related to the Support Vector Machine
* knn.py : Scripts related to the K Nearest Neighbors

In each file there are parameter that you can tweak, as indicated in pdf. .
